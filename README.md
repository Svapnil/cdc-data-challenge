# cdc-data-challenge

During the 2018 annual Carolina Datathon my team worked on visualizating mental health and poverty data in the United States and how it has changed over time. Using R and Python, the data was collected from the datasets given to us and translated into Z-score values against the mean of all the data given. From there it was converted into JSON and visualized using D3js.
